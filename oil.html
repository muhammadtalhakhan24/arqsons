<div id="o1">
<h2>Coconut Oil</h2>
<p>As you may be able to guess, coconut oil comes from coconuts. It is one of the most versatile oils in existence, and is also great for the skin. It contains large amounts of fatty acids which allow it to penetrate hair deeply without evaporating. Coconut oil is rich in carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals that are essential for good hair health. Coconut oil is available in several different varieties, such as refined, unrefined and extra-virgin, and is one of the best oils for hair growth.</p></div>
<h4>Ideal for</h4>
<p> All hair types, but particularly those with dry, damaged or dull hair. Coconut oil works well for those wishing to repair brittle hair and split ends, and is recommended for people with slow hair growth.</p>
<h4>Benefits</h4>
<p>Coconut oil has many benefits, including protecting against heat damage and repairing damaged and broken hair. Using it regularly also helps prevent hair loss and promotes healthy hair growth and a healthy scalp. Coconut oil improves the look of hair by helping it retain moisture and adding a beautiful, healthy shine. Many coconut oils also possess a delicious coconut scent that makes hair smell wonderful.</p>
<h4>How to use it</h4>
<p>Use organic coconut oil whenever possible. Since coconut oil is solid at room temperature, heating it up will soften it and allow for easier application. For those with an oily scalp: Apply to the hair, excluding the roots. For those with a dry scalp: Apply to the hair, including the roots. Leave it on for at least 30 minutes and rinse with your usual alcohol-free shampoo. Treating your hair once a week with coconut oil will help protect it against damage and keep it looking healthy and shiny.</p>
<div id="o2">
<h2>Argan Oil</h2>
<p>Argan oil, also known as Moroccan oil, is derived from nuts produced from argan trees. Rich in fatty acids, antioxidants and Vitamin E, argan oil not only makes your hair look wonderful, but also has many protective qualities. It is sometimes referred to as “liquid gold” due to its rich golden color. All-natural, organic argan oil is best to use, since it is minimally processed and does not contain any chemicals or additives.</p></div>
<h4>Ideal for</h4>
<p>Dry, brittle, frizzy or coarse hair that is frequently styled and exposed to heat. Also ideal for people with hair that tends to get greasy.</p>
<h4>Benefits</h4>
<p>Argan oil protects hair against damage from UV rays and heat. It also moisturizes and smoothes hair, making it soft and manageable and imparting a lustrous shine.</p>
<h4>How to use it</h4>
<p>Argan oil is viscous and can be poured at room temperature. Since it is not as greasy as coconut oil, you can use argan oil more frequently than once a week — even daily, if you like. The recommended use is to pour a few drops into your hands, rub them together, then apply to your hair, avoiding the roots. Argan oil can be applied to dry or damp hair and works great as a quick anti-frizz treatment. Here is a recipe for an argan oil hair repair mask.</p>
<div id="o3">
<h2>Jojoba Oil</h2>
<p>Jojoba oil, pronounced ho-ho-ba, is a product of the jojoba plant. Jojoba oil is ideal for use in the hair, since it shares many characteristics with sebum, the oil our scalps naturally produce. It won’t interfere with the scalp’s natural balance. Since it deeply penetrates the hair shaft and follicle, working from the inside out, jojoba oil is a great moisturizer. Jojoba oil also has antibacterial qualities. All-natural, unrefined jojoba oil is the best type to use on hair and skin, since it does not contain any chemical ingredients.</p></div>
<h4>Ideal for</h4>
<p>Dry, damaged or dull hair and those with dandruff and dry scalp issues.</p>
<h4>Benefits</h4>
<p>Jojoba oil moisturizes hair, prevents dandruff and dry scalp and makes hair soft and shiny.</p>
<h4>How to use it</h4>
<p>Jojoba oil can be used in a few different ways. It is viscous at room temperature and can be poured. As a leave-in treatment, you can apply it to your scalp before shampooing your hair, and leave it in for 30 minutes or longer. You can even leave it in overnight. Try adding a few drops to your conditioner or apply it straight to the ends of your hair after shampooing.</p>
<div id="o4">
<h2>Almond Oil</h2>
<p>Almond oil comes from the kernels inside almonds. Sweet almond oil comes from edible almonds that have been specifically grown to have a sweet taste. Not only great for cooking, sweet almond oil is also wonderful for your hair. It contains Vitamin E, fatty acids, proteins and antioxidants, along with magnesium, which reduces hair breakage and helps it grow. People with mineral deficiencies are prone to slow hair growth and hair loss, so adding some almond oil into your diet can also greatly help with these issues. Whether used for cooking or beauty care, all-natural sweet almond oil is best, as there are no added chemicals.</p></div>
<h4>Ideal for</h4>
<p>Dry and damaged hair, dandruff-prone hair and those with slow-growing hair or hair loss issues.</p>
<h4>Benefits</h4>
<p> Sweet almond oil moisturizes, seals and protects hair and also protects against hair loss and breakage. Using it regularly helps you grow longer and stronger hair.</p>
<h4>How to use it</h4>
<p>Almond oil is viscous at room temperature. Warm one tablespoon of oil and rub it into the scalp. You can leave it on overnight and wash it out the next morning. You may also want to use almond oil after you shampoo to restore moisture in hair and prevent breakage and split ends. Rub a few drops onto your palms and smooth it onto towel-dried hair. Combing it through your hair and allowing hair to air dry makes hair shiny and tangle-free.</p>
<div id="o5">
<h2>Olive Oil</h2>
<p>Olive oil is another extremely versatile oil, derived from pressing olives. It has protective and moisturizing properties. Since it coats the hair shaft and shields keratin, olive oil has protective qualities. It also has exfoliating and dandruff-fighting properties when combined with lemon juice. When used regularly, olive oil can replace the need to use conditioner and other hair-smoothing products. Organic, extra virgin olive oil is best, since it is rich in natural antioxidants and does not contain any chemical ingredients.</p></div>
<h4>Ideal for</h4>
<p>Damaged, dull, dry or frizzy hair, as well as hair that is dandruff-prone.</p>
<h4>Benefits</h4>
<p>Olive oil protects against heat damage, imparts a sleek look and shine, moisturizes and gives damaged and broken hair a healthy appearance.</p>
<h4>How to use it</h4>
<p>You can use olive oil as a weekly hair treatment on either dry or damp hair. Coat your hair with one to two tablespoons of olive oil and cover your hair with a shower cap for about 30 minutes. Be sure to shampoo hair thoroughly afterward and rinse with cold water. There is no need to use conditioner after an olive oil treatment. When used with lemon juice every other week, olive oil also fights dandruff. For this treatment, mix a few tablespoons each of water, olive oil and lemon juice. Rub it into the scalp and leave it on for 20 minutes before you shampoo it out.</p>
<div id="o6">
<h2>Grapeseed Oil</h2>
<p>Grapeseed oil is an extract of cold-pressed grape seeds. It contains emollients, antioxidants and nutrients that are essential to the growth of healthy hair and skin cells. While it possesses the same moisturizing qualities as many other natural oils, grapeseed oil is superior in its ability to treat brittle and weak hair and hair loss. It is also an effective dandruff and dermatitis fighter and may help people regrow hair. This light and versatile green-colored oil is also beneficial for heart health when used for cooking. Pure, all-natural grapeseed oil is the best type to use for both cooking and skin and hair care purposes.</p></div>
<h4>Ideal for</h4>
<p> Dry, dull hair and brittle hair, hair that is prone to getting greasy and dandruff-prone hair. It is also effective at combating hair loss.</p>
<h4>Benefits</h4>
<p>Grapeseed oil moisturizes and conditions hair. It also makes hair strong and healthy and is effective in treating frizz and split ends. Grapeseed oil is helpful in fighting dandruff and reduces scalp inflammation in those who suffer from dermatitis. In addition, it blocks the production of DHT, a hormone that causes hair loss. The high content of Vitamin E in grapeseed oil encourages the production of linoleic acid, which helps restore strength and shine to weak and brittle hair.</p>
<h4>How to use it</h4>
<p>Grapeseed oil is lightweight compared to many of the others on this list, making it ideal for frequent use. It also does not have any kind of odor. To use as a deep conditioning treatment, coat your hair with a few tablespoons of grapeseed oil and leave it on for 10 minutes. Rinse with cold water for shiny and moisturized hair. For dandruff treatment, rub oil directly into the scalp and allow it to absorb. As an overnight treatment, coat hair with warm grapeseed oil, cover with a shower cap or towel and wash it out in the morning. Grapeseed oil also makes a great carrier oil for essential oils that aid in stress relief and relaxation of hair follicles.</p>
<div id="o7">
<h2>Lavender Oil</h2>
<p>Lavender oil is an essential oil derived from lavender flowers. Studies have shown the topical use of lavender oil promotes hair growth. It increases the number of hair follicles on the head, resulting in fuller and thicker hair. It also has antimicrobial and antiseptic qualities, which make it ideal for use by people with dandruff. When used to massage the scalp and mixed with a carrier oil, it improves circulation, stimulates hair growth and can even prevent hair loss. The hair follicles that grow when the scalp is treated with lavender oil are rooted more deeply, causing less hair loss.</p></div>
<h4>Ideal for</h4>
<p>All hair types, especially those who tend to have oily hair in the front and back and dry scalp in other areas.</p>
<h4>Benefits</h4>
<p>Lavender oil promotes hair growth without the side effects caused by other topical hair growth products. It prevents hair loss, moisturizes the scalp and balances sebum production. Its regular use results in fuller and thicker hair. Along with its many benefits to the hair and scalp, lavender oil is also proven to relieve stress, which is also a cause of hair loss. Lavender oil also has a distinct and pleasant aroma.</p>
<h4>How to use it</h4>
<p> Since lavender oil is an essential oil, mix it with a carrier oil such as warm olive or coconut oil. If using as a scalp massage, mix eight to 10 drops of lavender oil with two tablespoons of a carrier oil and massage into the scalp. Leave it on overnight, covering hair with a towel or shower cap. Shampoo hair in the morning. You can also add a few drops to your shampoo or conditioner for moisturized and great-smelling hair.</p>

<div id="o8">
<h2>Lemongrass Oil</h2>
<p>Lemongrass oil is an essential oil derived from an herb in the Poaceae grass family. It contains many vitamins and minerals that are great for the hair. Lemongrass oil has healing qualities and works well for a variety of hair and scalp issues. Lemongrass oil is also proven to strengthen hair follicles and prevent and reduce hair loss.</p></div>
<h4>Ideal for</h4>
<p>All hair types, but particularly beneficial for people who experience dry scalp and dandruff. It also strengthens hair follicles in people with hair loss.</p>
<h4>Benefits</h4>
<p>Lemongrass oil possesses antifungal and antiviral properties, and is effective in relieving dry scalp and dandruff. It is proven to inhibit dandruff caused by yeast issues. Lemongrass oil also prevents hair loss and gives hair a healthy shine. It also smells fresh and clean, and is a known stress reliever.</p>
<h4>How to use it</h4>
<p>You can add about 10 drops of lemongrass oil to your bottle of shampoo or conditioner. When using as a scalp massage, add two or three drops to your hair along with your conditioner. Remember, never apply essential oils to your scalp or skin without a carrier such as coconut oil or olive oil.</p>
