Meanwhile, there are also some rare varieties of the gem which are significantly costly, such as Demantoid and Tsavorite. It is in fact the rarity which adds to their price.</p>

<h4>Chemical Composition of a Pearl</h4>
<p>Do you have any idea about the composition of the extremely beautiful gemstones, you call pearls? By composition, they are made up of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and a tough, insoluble proteinous compound, called conchiolin.<br> Both the compounds, i.e. calcium carbonate and conchiolin, are secreted by an oyster or mussel.
